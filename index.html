      Hi! We are Paul and Chris and together we create the Disturbing Works
      Studio.
      <br><br>
      When the Night Falls is our first project, a survival game with a
      dense horror atmosphere. We have created a randomly generated 2d world of
      unique digital hand drawing embedded in a 3D world. Our story will take
      you to a dark forest dominated by horror monsters. The longest night in
      the forest unleashes dark forces and forces the inhabitants to seek
      shelter and help. As a Keeper of the Forest, you will try to help the weaker
      and find a way to restore daylight. You will build a new society in the
      middle of the dark forest and save them from the evil hidden in the deep
      forest.
      <br><br>
      Most of the creatures in the game are influenced by Slovenian
      myths and stories. We try to create a world known from fairy tales told to
      children before bedtime, when most families lived in the villages
      surrounded by a wild dark forest and stimulated the human imagination.
      Back then, people based their beliefs on nature. There were good spirits
      and bad spirits in the forest. They were an important part of human life
      and tradition. A rich and inspiring tradition.
